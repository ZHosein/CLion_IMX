## Problem 10?
OpenCV version on IMX (4.6.0, while seemingly able to perform the required functionalities, it does so in a different way than the latest version (the one I've been practicing with, (4.9.x)).

Cross-compile the latest ver of OpenCV and install on IMX or change code used for pose detection?
-    The later might require re-building OpenCV 4.6.0 on local machine for testing purposes.
